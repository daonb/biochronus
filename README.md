# BioChronus

Javascript code to display a life's story.
Using [Konva.js](https://github.com/konvajs/konva), a thin HTML5 canvas to
display life's periods, photos thumbnails and 
[PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) to display images.

Other than that it's all plain javascript, without even jQuery to help.
If you're not sure how to do things in plain js, please use
(plainjs)[https://plainjs.com/] for samples and instruction.

## creating your own BioChronus

TL:DR; 

```
$ cd bios
$ cp giza.js local.js
$ [use your favorite editor]
```

The biochronus gets his data from a single json file. This file contains the
personal data, life's periods and the images. You're invited to fork the project
and start working on your own local file which will be automaticlly loaded
and override grandma giza bio.
