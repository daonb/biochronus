# giza.js

    In memory of Giza Goldfarb, @daonb's grandmother may her sole rest in peace

This is a shot at displaying a life's story in a circle on an HTML5 canvas 
using [Konva.js](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) and
[PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) to display the photos.

## creating your own BioChronus

The biochronus gets his data from a single js file. This file contains the
personal data, life's spans and the images. You're invited to fork the project
and start working on your own local file which will be automaticlly loaded
and override grandma giza bio. 

```
$ cd bios
$ cp giza.js local.js
$ [edit local.js and make it your own]
$ firefox index.html
```
